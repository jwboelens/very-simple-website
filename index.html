<p>Hi, I‚Äôm Jan-Willem and have a cat named Bob. I have no need for a website, but here we are.</p>

<p>I <s>hate all</s> have no social media.</p>

<h3>This website</h3>

<p>The lack of design or other fancy things is on purpose. The web these days is broken with websites that take 10 seconds to load. I hate that. Speed is key. No trackers, cookies or other crap.</p>

<p>Built with Github and Netlify.</p>
