<p>Hi, Iâ€™m Jan-Willem and have a cat named Bob. I have no need for a website, but here we are.</p>

<p>During the day I work at Sunrise Medical, where I build stuff for the web, among other cool things.</p>

<p>Things I like: taking <a href="https://photos.janwillem.xyz">photos</a>, complaining about things, watching <a href="https://letterboxd.com/janwillem">movies</a>, cycling and my cat Bob.<p>

<p>I <s>hate all</s> have no social media.</p>

<hr>

<h3>This website</h3>

<p>The lack of design or other fancy things is on purpose. The web these days is broken with websites that take 10 seconds to load. I hate that. Speed is key.</p>

<p>Built with Github and Netlify.</p>

16gb / 512gb. This is my main computer. Coming from a MacBook Pro from 2017 that I did not like at all, this thing is great. It's fast, silent and does everything I want..</p>
