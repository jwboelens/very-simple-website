	<p>Hi.</p>
	<p>I'm Jan-Willem and I build stuff.</p>

	<p>I work at Sunrise Medical where I help create things for the web. 
	Before that I held design leadership roles at fashion and fintech startups, and was as a senior designer at a global agency.

	<p>Iâ€™m a co-founder of the community and event series Design Club, and an investor & advisor to Bricklane. 
	Sometimes I like to give talks and write about process, hiring, and the business of design.</p>
