I am a Growth Marketing Manager at VanMoof. I like to optimize websites based on insights and data for the user and VanMoof. To achieve the companyâ€™s ultimate goal of getting the next billion on bikes. My main focus is on CRO, SEO, and Web Analytics.

Previously I worked as a Senior CRO Analyst at Fietsenwinkel.nl, Conversion Specialist and Web Analyst at The Next Web, Online Marketeer (focus on CRO & SEO) at Van der Valk Exclusief, and I was an Online Business Developer at Budeco.
