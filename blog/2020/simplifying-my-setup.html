<h1>Simplifying My Setup</h1>  
  
<p>At my job I have a 2 x 24” monitor setup connected to my laptop with the lid closed. 
I love it, but I’ve noticed something. When I’m using my laptop without the extra monitors, I actually feel more productive. 
There is less distraction, so I’m focusing more on the actual thing that I’m doing.</p>

<p>Usually I have my Monday boards open on the monitor on the left and a browser on the right. 
But I’m constantly looking at the things in Monday that I don’t even have to do yet. 
So, when working from home, I’m going back to one monitor to keep me focused on the thing I’m doing.</p>

<h3>144hz</h3>

<p>For my personal gaming / browsing / whatever setup I’ve decided to transition from a 27” 4K monitor to a Full HD 144hz monitor. 
I bought the AOC 24G2U 144hz monitor as a extra monitor next to my 4K screen, but my god is 144hz smooth! 
The moment I went to settings and changed it to 144hz, my mouse movement felt so incredibly smooth.</p>

<p>So far I love it. Just one very smooth monitor, my Leopold FC750R keyboard and my Logitech G502 Hero mouse.</p>
