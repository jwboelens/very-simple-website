<p>Thinking more and more about making the iPad my main computing device. 
Not the Pro, don’t really see the point in owning one (besides the bigger screen), but my 2018 iPad.</p>

<p>The more I sit behind my MacBook (and the more stories I read about people who made the transition), the more I think: can’t I do this on my iPad? 
With a clicky keyboard. Obviously…

<p>I’m looking for a small stand for the iPad, so it can stand up nicely on my desk and I don’t need to look down constantly.
